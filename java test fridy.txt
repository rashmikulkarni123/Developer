3. what are the generalized and specilized classses in java?
--> The generalized class is nothing but a parent class or a super class
--> The speclized class is nothing but a child class or a sub class


4a. i dont want my class to be inherited by any other class. what should i do?
--> we should not put extend keyword to inherit the other class


4b. can you give a few examples of final classes defined in API?
-->  when we use extend keyword we cannot modify the program
--> we cannot inherit the class
--> we use final keyword in abstraction.
java.lang.string
java.lang.math 


4c. what are some alternatives to inheritance?
-->  Deligation can be alternative to inheritance 
     Deligataion means that you use an object of another class as an instance variable, and forward message to the innstance


5. which sorted collection have you used?
-->  Comparator
--> Comparable


6. what is the difference between linkedlist and arraylist in java?
--> Linked List
    1. Linked list uses a doubly linkedlist
    2. Linked list is use to manipulate data
    3. Linked list is faster in read operation
    4. Writing is slower than arraylist
   
--> ArrayList
    1. Arraylist is a dynamic array
    2. Arraylist is used to store and fetch the data
    3. Arraylist is slower in read operation
    4. ArrayList is faster in writing


7. what is the difference between betweeen listiterator and itrator?
--> ListIterator
   1. Can traverse elements present in Collection both in forward and backward directions.
   2. Can only traverse List and not the other two. 
   3. It has methods like nextIndex() and previousIndex() to obtain indexes of elements at any time while traversing List.
--> Iterator
  1. Iterator can traverse only in forward direction whereas ListIterator traverses both in forward and backward directions.
  2. Helps to traverse Map, List and Set.
  3. Indexes cannot be obtained by using Iterator.


8. what is the covariant method overriding in java?
--> when override in a method in child class the return type may vary is know as covariant method overriding in java


9.what is memory leakage in java?
-->A Memory Leak is a situation where there are objects present in the heap that are no longer used,
   but the garbage collector is unable to remove them from memory and therefore they're unnecessarily maintained.


10. explain static polymorphims and dynamic polymorphism?
 * Static polymorphism is polymorphism that occurs at compile time.
--> An aspect of static polymorphism is early binding. In early binding the specific method to call is resolved at compile time.
--> Early binding is faster because there is no runtime overhead. 
--> Early binding is the default behavior.
 * dynamic polymorphism is polymorphism that occurs at runtime.
--> Dynamic polymorphism in Java refers to the process when a call to an overridden process is resolved at the run time. 
--> The reference variable of a superclass calls the overridden method. 
--> Dynamic polymorphism happens among different classes as opposed to static polymorphism.

11. Hema created a class called personal information and she want to give security for the properties how can she achive?
--> we can achive it by using access specifer called "private"
